### Stocks & Bonds 
### The Game of Investments 

STOCKS & BONDs will transport you to Wall Street as you attempt to gain wealth and affluence by skillfully buying and selling securities.  The game is for 2 to 8 players – appeals to both juniors and adults. 

The main object of STOCKS & BONDS is to shrewdly invest $5,000 in the game’s 10 securities, buying and selling for 10 years (rounds) in an attempt to become the wealthiest player. 

#### TERMS 

SECURITY – A stock or bond. 

BOND – An interest-bearing certificate issued by a private or municipal corporation, usually for the purpose of borrowing money.  I the game bonds are issued in $1,000, $5,000, and $10,000 denominations. 

INTEREST – Set percentage of bond’s value paid to the investor. In the game annual interest (in dollars) is shown on each certificate. 

STOCK – Shares or holdings in a corporation business enterprise attested by certificates of ownership.  In the game stock certificates are issued in denominations of 10, 50 and 100 shares. 

DIVIDENED – Portion of a company’s profit distributed to the stockholders.  In the game annual dividend (in dollars) is shown on each certificate. 

SPLIT (or Stock Split) - The division of shares into a larer number.  For example, if a company declares a 2-for-1 split, each shareholder receives free one additional share for each one they already owns; the price per share is halved.  Usually this is done to make the stocker easier to sell. 

TRANSACTION – Purchase or sale of securities. 

MARGIN PURCHASE – Buying securities on credit.  (See Buying on Margin.) 

ROUND LOT – A unit of trading.  In the game only round lots of 10 shares or multiples thereof may be purchased or sold. 

BEAR MARKET – A declining market.  The Situation Card for the current year indicates when the Bear Market side of the Market Price Card is to be used. 

BULL MARKET – An advancing market.  The Situation Card for the current year indicates when the Bull Market side of the Market Price Card is to be used. 

MARKET PRICE – The last reported price at which a stock or bond sold. 

#### SETUP 

Choose one player as Board Person and another as Broker.  The Board Person receives the marker and Stock Board on which they post the current market prices.  The Broker receives the Market Price Card, which determines the current market prices, and is also responsible for issuing the stock certificates and bonds throughout the game.  Each player receives a Record Sheet which indicates that they have $5,000 to invest as they choose.  The Situation Cards are shuffled and stacked face down on the table. 

#### PLAY 

During each of the ten years of play, each player invests in securities of their choice, buying and selling at the current market price for the year.  As a guide in selecting investments, players should consult the Securities Review (printed on back page of this folder).  All stock is sold only in blocks of ten shares. 

YEAR 1 consists of the following, in order: 

1. ESTABLISHING BULL OR BEAR MARKET.  Broker draws a Situation Card and announces whether the market indicated for the year is Bull or Bear.  They then locate the correct side (Bull or Bear) of the Market Price Card. 

2. DETERMINING CURRENT MARKET PRICE OF STOCKS.  Board Person rolls dice and Broker, rolling instructions on Market Price Card, sets it for number rolled.  After reading aloud the bulletin on the Situation Card, Broker refers to Market Price Card and, taking into account what the Situation Card said, announces how many points each stock rose or fell.  Board Person marks the new prices for the year on the Stock Board.  The pre-game price of all stocks is $100 per share; bonds are sold at par value - $1,000, $5,000, or $10,000 – and their prices does not fluctuate during the game.  When the price of a stock reaches $150 or more, the stock splits 2-for-1 (see Stock Splits). 

Example: if in Year 1 Stryker Drilling declines 20 points, the price posted for that stock would be $80 (pre-game price of $100 minus the 20 points the stock dropped).  However, if the Situation Card drawn for the year indicated that Stryker rose 17 points, the posted price for Year 1 would be $97 (down 20 points and up 17 from the pre-game price of $100). 

3. BUYING SECURITIES.  After the current market prices have been posted, Broker announces the floor is open for buying.  Each player may buy stocks at the price posted on the Board and bonds at their par value (see Sample Record Sheet #1).  As soon as the player has recorded their purchases on their Record Sheet, they report them to the Broker and receives the certificates for the shares purchased. 

YEARS 2-10 consist of the following in order: 

1. POSTING DIVIDENS AND INTEREST.  At the beginning of each year, each player checks their certificates to see how much they have gained in dividends and/or interest and records the total amount in the Dividends and Interest column on their Record Sheet (see Sample Record Sheet #2). 

NO DIVIDENS.  If the price of a stock drop below $50, players holding that stock receive no dividends.  When the price again reaches $50, the payment of dividends is resumed. 

2. ESTABLISHING BULL OR BEAR MARKET.  Broker establishes market each year as for Year 1. 

3. DETERMING CURRENT MARKET PRICE OF STOCK.  Each year, prices are determined as for Year 1 except that points are added to or subtracted from previous year’s price. 

Example: If in Year 2 Stryker Drilling rose 45 points and the price for Year 1 had been $80, the price posted would be $125 ($80 plus 45 points). 

STOCK SPLITS. When the price of a stock reaches $150 or more, the stock splits 2-for-1.  The price of the stock is halved and the split is recorded on the Board (see Sample Stock Board).  If the price will not divide into even dollar amounts, it is raised to the next higher dollar.  The number of shares in that stock held by a player is doubled and they receive the proper amount of stock certificates. 

WORTHLESS STOCK.  When the price of a stock drops to $0 or below, the corporation is declared bankrupt.  Players owning this stock must surrender their certificates, receiving nothing for them.  The price of the stock is re-established the following year in the same manner as for Year 1. 

4. SELLING SECURITIES. After the current market price of each stock has been posted, the Broker announces that the floor is now open for selling.  Players then record any sales they wish to make at these prices and the Broker collects the certificates for any stocks which have been sold (see Sample Record Sheet #2). 

5. BUYING SECURITIES. When all selling transactions have been completed, the floor is declared open for buying.  After checking their Cash Balance, each player may buy stocks at posted prices and bonds at par value.  After recording their transactions, players report them to the Broker and receive their certificates. 

#### CLOSINGS 

At the end of the 10 years, closing prices are posted (determine as for any other year).  Each player figures how much the securities they hold are worth and adds this figure to their Cash Balance. (Remember, each player started with $5,000.) WEALTHIEST PLAYER WINS THE GAME. 

#### OPTIONAL 

The players may decide before the game to roll the dice for each security to determine the first year price per share.  Each year following the dice will be rolled once to determine the price per share for all securities, OR: 

The players may decide before the game to roll the dice for each security throughout the game. (The market-bull or bear- remins the same thoughout the year).  However, if this variation is used, should a 2 or 12 be rolled all prices posted for that year are affected (erased), and the points (numbers) on the Market Price Card for that number (2 or 12) are used to determine that year’s prices. 

#### BUYING ON MARGIN 

As you become more experienced in STOCKS & BONDS, you may wish to vary the game by including Buying on Margin.  You buy on margin if you wish to have more working capital (gained by only paying part of the purchase price in that year). 

MARGIN: The amount paid by the investor when they use credit to buy a security, the balance being advanced by their broker.  Interest is paid on this balance by the investor until the balance is paid.  margin for the is set at 50%, and players will be charged 5% per year on their unpaid Margin Total. 

TO BUY ON MARGIN.  A margin purchase may not be made until the year following your first cash purchase.  When buying on margin, record the transaction in the usual way with the following exceptions: 

1. Record only 50% (½) of the total purchase price in the Amount Paid column.  Circle this amount to indicate it is a margin purchase. 

2. Add an equal amount (50% of the total purchase price) to the Margin Total column.  (This column represents the total owed on Margin). 

Collect the certificates due you.  The following year you must pay the Charges due on the your Margin Total.  Record these Charges after you record any dividends and/or interest due you.  The Charges (5% of Margin Total) are recorded each year in the Margin Charges (Pd.) column.  Your Cash Balance at the end of a year must be enough to cover the Charges due in the next year.  If you Cash Balance is less than Charges due, you must sell one or more of your securities to cover the upcoming Charges.  If you are unable to raise enough money to meet your obligations, you are declared bankrupt and are out of the game. 

If a security held on margin is sold, the balance due on that stock must be paid immediately.  All margin balances must be paid before the Closing year.  No margin purchases may be made in the 10th year. 

If the price of a stock held on margin drops to $25 or below, you must immediately pay the margin balance due on this stock.  If the price of a stock drops to $0 or below, the certificates are surrendered, and you must immediately pay the balance. 

To pay up a margin balance, record the amount owed (50% of total purchase price) in the Amount Paid column.  Draw a line through the corresponding circled amount to indicate this margin purchase has been paid.  Subtract the amount paid from your Margin Total Column.  (Remember to re-figure your Charges for the next year.) 

To figure Margin Charges (5% of Margin Total column), simply drop last digit and divide by two.
